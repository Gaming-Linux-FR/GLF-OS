# GLF-OS

Gaming Linux Fr is a community of enthusiasts built around a Discord and a website.
We are the first French-speaking community dedicated to gaming on Linux.

We regularly launch projects to improve Linux accessibility. For example, we have already worked on scripts for Arch Linux (Architect), as well as applications to facilitate software installation, such as Easy Flatpak.

Our community also performs audit exercises, to highlight the Linux distributions that come closest to our ideal vision. This vision is focused on newcomers (out-of-the-box installation), multimedia and gaming, straight from the installation stage.

And it was by combining these two exercises that the idea of creating our own distribution was born: to deliver a stable, accessible, gaming-oriented operating system. It meets all the GLF specifications.

This project is first and foremost a community project, for Gaming Linux Fr. It's also a challenge, taken up by our community.
